  <h2>Reflection and Insights</h2>
  <p>Describe your experience using the two different CMSs.<br> What have you learned through this assignment regarding the different systems?<br /> This should be thoughtful and to-the-point; not a complete review of the two different systems, but your
    lessons learned.</p>
	
	<p> My experience while using Joomla is its kinda hard to use it because we use article but thankfully i found a plugin called JCE Editor that make the editing much easier because this plugin gives the preview and code features
	and while editing the content its kinda hard to make them align beautifully but i was help with the virtuemart plugin where i can just make a products list and the plugin help me to manage the products into the pages.
	overall joomla can be understand quite easily and you can make greate content with joomla if u found the right plugin to work with. I managed to understand Joomla in 3 days after i play with it features.</p>
	
	<p> My experience with wordpress is that its pretty fun and easy to make website with this, because wordpress gives us blocks where we can edit it much easier for instance if u want to add video, wordpress gives us the blocks to add video so we dont need to find a way how to add it
	and manage the content is much easier because there are styling page where we can easily style the content, <br>and for the shop features i use woocommerece this plugin is very helpfull and easy to use, you just need to add products and choose a block. By using wordpress i learned how to use blocks </p>
